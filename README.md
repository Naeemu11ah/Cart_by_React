# Shopping Cart by React

This was my **first React project**, where I built a simple shopping cart system. The app allows users to add products, remove products, adjust quantities, and see the total price update dynamically. Styling is handled using **Bootstrap** for quick UI design.

## Features

- You can add Products to Cart by entering product name and price
- Can Remove Products from Cart
- Can Choose how many units of prducts you want to buy.
- Total price increases or decreases as you add, remove, or adjust quantity.
